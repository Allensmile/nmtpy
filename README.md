nmtpy
====

nmtpy is a suite of Python tools, primarily based on the starter code provided in [dl4mt-material](https://github.com/kyunghyuncho/dl4mt-material) for training neural machine translation networks using Theano.

Installation
----

Create a link to the GIT repository so that whenever you issue a `git pull`, you start using the latest version automatically:

```
python setup.py develop
```

This is also crucial for `nmt-train` in case you create a new model file under `nmtpy/models`.
