nmtpy
====

nmtpy is a suite of Python tools, primarily based on the starter code provided in [dl4mt-material](https://github.com/kyunghyuncho/dl4mt-material) for training neural machine translation networks using Theano.

Installation
----
You can install nmtpy to your local Python environment using the command below:
```
$ python setup.py install
```

Another alternative is to create a link to the GIT repository so that whenever you issue a `git pull`, you start using the latest version automatically:
```
python setup.py develop
```
